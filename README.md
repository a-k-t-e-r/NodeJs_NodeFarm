# Node Farm

It's a simple Node Js Project, where some lists of data comes from a Local API file and organize them according to Project templete design. And, each data item is identified by unique Ids so, when user click on each item, it will bring user to the details page and render data via specific API. Things I have exploited to construct this project:
- Node HTTP Web Server
- Node Routing Mechanism
- Reading and Writing Files
- Blocking and Non-Blocking Asynchronous Nature of Node.js
- Parsing Variables from URLs
